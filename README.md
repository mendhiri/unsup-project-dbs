## BMLP Final Submission - Ghiffari Kenang Sagraha

This repository contains the final submissions for the BMLP (Big Data Machine Learning Program) in two categories: **Classification** and **Clustering**. Each submission includes an analysis, model development, and evaluation.

## Repository Structure
- `[Klasifikasi] Submission Akhir BMLP_Ghiffari Kenang Sagraha.html` - Final submission for classification tasks
- `[Clustering] Submission Akhir BMLP_Ghiffari Kenang Sagraha.html` - Final submission for clustering tasks

## Contents
### Classification Submission
This notebook covers:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Performance evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)

### Clustering Submission
This notebook covers:
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Implementation of clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Evaluation using cluster validation techniques (e.g., silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index)
- Interpretation of clustering results

## How to Use
1. Open the `.html` files in a web browser to review the detailed analysis and results.
2. The notebooks provide step-by-step explanations of the methodologies used in each submission.

## Requirements
These submissions were developed using Python with common data science libraries, including:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
